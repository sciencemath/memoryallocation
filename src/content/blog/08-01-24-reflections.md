  My thoughts and reflections
---

Hello all! I have been busy for several months and felt it was a good time to reflect.

<br>I haven't been working for several months, but luckily I saved just enough to survive to complete the mathematics I have wanted to learn finally. The journey isn't over and I don't think it will ever be. I have gotten to a milestone where I can go back to programming for the web full-time (I still need to pay rent).

<br>I've always had a passion for math and creativity, I am certain mathematics will help you, myself, and everyone in all areas of life. A term that was used a lot when math is taught is "When will I ever use this", when somebody had mentioned this back then I thought it was true, but now it's false more than ever.

<br>The reason why I took some time off to pursue mathematics is not only to deeply understand research papers but also because there are a ton of people jumping on the "Ai" train with the rise of LLMs I know mathematics is very important to understand the underlying models or creating your own models rather than fitting puzzle pieces from a XYZ library anyone can do this but I like to step back and make sure I understand the bigger picture.

<br>If you want to get into Quantum Computing we should all have a solid understanding of probability theory, functional analysis, and more. Most everything seems to boil down to some sort of high-level math to have a solid foundation or if you want to be good at anything.

<br>I did have to go back to review math that I may have forgotten which was essential if I wanted to learn further:
<br><br>

<ul>
<li>Algebra 1 and 2</li>
<li>Geometry
<li>Trigonometry
<li>Precalculus
<li>Statistics & Probability
<li>Calculus AB and BC
<li>Multivariable Calculus
<li>Differential Equations
<li>Linear Algebra
</ul>

<br>Each topic deserves a post on its own and the journey I had with each but that might be a bit boring to read :). I tried not to rush anything. All my time went to research, learning, completing many exercises, tons of notes, a lot of coffee, and countless hours in front of a screen till 1 or 2 in the morning. I took one day off for my bday but I felt bad for doing that.

<br>Maybe it's a midlife crisis telling me that life is going by so fast and I have so much to learn still.

<br>Now its time to update resume and update this site with a fresh look.
